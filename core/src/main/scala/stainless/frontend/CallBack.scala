/**
  * Process the extracted units.
  *
  * Frontends are required to follow this workflow (== one cycle):
  *  - when starting extracting compilation unit, [[beginExtractions]] should be called once;
  *  - the [[CallBack.apply]] method after extracting each compilation unit (i.e. a Scala file);
  *  - the [[CallBack.failed]] method if the compilation unit extraction failed (or it contained errors);
  *  - finally, the frontend calls [[endExtractions]] to let the CallBack know all the data
  *    should be available by now.
  *
  * When a compilation unit is recompiled, the callback deals with any potential invalidation of
  * existing data without blocking the callee's thread.
  *
  * A [[Frontend]] has to [[stop]] or [[join]] its callback at some point between two cycles.
  * A callback cannot be reused after calling [[stop]].
  *
  * Calling [[getReport]] is valid exclusively after [[join]]ing and before the next cycle starts.
  *
  * A callback is expected to be used by only one frontend at a time.
